# ScrollSmoother Setup (Licensed Build)

This project expects the Club GSAP plugin file at:

- `public/assets/js/vendors/ScrollSmoother.min.js`

## What to do

1. Download your licensed `ScrollSmoother.min.js` from GreenSock (Club GSAP account).
2. Place it at `public/assets/js/vendors/ScrollSmoother.min.js`.
3. Keep filename exactly the same.

## Behavior if missing

If `ScrollSmoother` is not present, the site falls back to normal `ScrollTrigger` behavior and hero video scroll-scrub still works.
